1,US athlete Shelby McEwen has defended his decision not to accept a shared gold medal at Paris 2024 which cost him the chance to be Olympic champion. McEwen was competing in the mens high jump final on Saturday night as the games drew to a close and was tied in first place with New Zealands Hamish Kerr after clearing the 2.36m jump. Both then failed to clear 2.38m and as they had the same number of failed jumps they were completely level (Picture: Getty Images),"{'athlete': 1, 'Shelby': 1, 'McEwen': 2, 'defended': 1, 'decision': 1, 'accept': 1, 'shared': 1, 'gold': 1, 'medal': 1, 'Paris': 1, '2024': 1, 'cost': 1, 'chance': 1, 'Olympic': 1, 'champion': 1, 'competing': 1, 'men\x92s': 1, 'high': 1, 'jump': 2, 'final': 1, 'Saturday': 1, 'night': 1, 'games': 1, 'drew': 1, 'close': 1, 'tied': 1, 'place': 1, 'New': 1, 'Zealand\x92s': 1, 'Hamish': 1, 'Kerr': 1, 'clearing': 1, '2.36': 1, 'm': 2, 'failed': 2, 'clear': 1, '2.38': 1, 'number': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'completely': 1, 'level': 1, 'Picture': 1, 'Getty': 1, 'Images': 1}"
